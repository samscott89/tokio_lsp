Tokio LSP
=========

Basic implementation of a [tokio](https://tokio.rs) client for working
with [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://langserver.org/) servers.

This is a WIP, but is fairly simple and should work for basic uses.

Issues, PRs, and contributions are more than welcome.

This project largely depends on:
 - [tokio_jsonrpc](https://github.com/vorner/tokio-jsonrpc)
 - [languageserver_types](https://github.com/gluon-lang/languageserver-types)

Some projects which were used for inspiration/ideas/code:
 - [lsp-client](https://github.com/cmyr/lsp-client/)
 - [RustLSP](https://github.com/RustDT/RustLSP)
